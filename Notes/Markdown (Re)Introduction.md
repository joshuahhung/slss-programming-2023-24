# Headings 
We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols
To create subheadings, we can use multiple hash symbols

## This is a level 2 subheading

### This is a level 3 subheading

###### This is a level 6 subheading


# Modifying Text Style

## Bold and *Italics*
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling, specifically
bold and italics

e.g.
I want this **word** specifically to be bold
I want this *word* to be italicized
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized

## Escape Characters
**ASIDE**: If we want to place a character that is a KEYWORD or *reserved word*, and we want the LITERAL character, use the forward slash (\\)
	e.g. if we want to put put an asterisk, we do this \\*

## ~~Strikethrough~~
We can also strikethrough characters using the tilde (~)
I want to strikethrough this specific word ~~word~~
~~This sentence is struck through~~


# Link
We can link things in our Markdown files
[One tool to use](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise:
* Ask ChatGPT to create for me a markdown code that is a link to two websites of my choice

e.g. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) 

e.g. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com)

e.g. if I use OpenAI
Put in the code, and in italics say that its from ChatGPT
[A search engine](https://www.google.com/?hl=fr) from *ChatGPT*

1. [Google](https://www.google.com/?hl=fr)
2. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) *from ChatGPT*

# Blockquotes 
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text.
We use carets (>) to create blockquotes.

> This is an example of a blockquote
> This is line two of the blockquote 
> 
> This is the fourth line; the third is blank with a >


# Lists
We can create both unordered and ordered lists

# Unordered Lists
To create each point, we use (\*) with a space behind it

e.g.
* Dairy
	* eggs
	* milk
	* cheese
* juice



# Ordered Lists
If there is a specific order to the elements in our list,
we create ordered lists
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists

e.g.
1. Put butter into mixing bowl
2. Add sugar to butter (*hold shift tog et the second line*)
   Add both brown and regular sugar
3. Use a the mixer to cream the butter and sugar together


# Tables
We can organize information in tables using Markdown 
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|) 

Tables in Markdown require headings

e.g.

| Name         | Age        | Sign        | Superpower |
| ---          | ---        | ---         | ---        |
| Bruce Wayne  | 35         | Aquarius.   | Money      |
| Mr. Ubial    | Unaging    | All of them | None       |
| Josh         | 17         | Libra       | Mind       |
